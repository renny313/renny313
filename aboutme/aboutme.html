    <p>Hi Everyone. My name is Esther Olukayode. I was born and reside in West Africa, Lagos, Nigeria.
        I'm currently pursing a major in Software Development from BYU-Idaho. </p>
        <p>I've always been passionate about new developments since i was young and i think coding 
            is one thing i picked interest in lately.
            In my free time, i enjoy reading, sketching and seeing movies.</p>
            <p>One reason why i love BYU is the fact the teachings
                are relevant and balance the spiritual, physical and social life.</p>
                <p>I'm looking forward to having a wonderful experience with you all. <br>
                    Thank you for checking my webpage.</p>
